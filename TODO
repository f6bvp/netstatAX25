This file lists planned features for future versions of netstatAX25.

Next Planned Version (v1.0.1 or v1.1.0)

    Display Va: Add the display of the Va value (Unacknowledged Frames) to the output.
    This value must be read from the appropriate field in /proc/net/ax25 and integrated with the same level of compatibility as the existing Vs and Vr fields.

    Documentation: Update the README.md and CHANGELOG after the implementation of the Va display.

    Code Cleanup: Review error handling functions to ensure messages remain consistent after the addition of Va functionality.

Future Improvements

    Filtering: Add the ability to filter the output by callsign or by connection state.

    Verbose Mode: Introduce an option to display detailed timing information (T1, T2, N2, etc.) which are not visible in the default output.

    Add optional color command parameter

    Add -v verbose mode to display statistics link parameters t1, t2, t3, iddle, net ...

    Create a similar procutils.c version for future /proc/net/ax25 format including headers procutils.c
