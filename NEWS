net: ax25: Add header line to /proc/net/ax25 for ABI consistency

The current format of /proc/net/ax25 is an outlier within the Linux
amateur radio networking subsystem, as it lacks a descriptive header
line that is present in both /proc/net/rose and /proc/net/nr. This
inconsistency forces external tools to rely on hard-coded column
indexes, making them fragile and difficult to maintain.

This patch introduces a header line to /proc/net/ax25, aligning its
format with its peers.

ABI BREAKAGE JUSTIFICATION:
Introducing a header line constitutes an Application Binary Interface
(ABI) break for user-space applications that parse this file, as it
shifts the column positions by one line. This break is justified
because:

1.  CONSISTENCY: This change normalizes the output, making the AX.25
    interface consistent with other protocols in the same amateur radio
    namespace (ROSE and Net/Rom). This improves the predictability of
    the entire subsystem.

2.  ROBUSTNESS & FUTURE-PROOFING: The existing format provides zero
    metadata, making it impossible for user-space tools to detect any
    future changes in column order, count, or type. The header acts as
    a minimal **versioning mechanism**, allowing external applications
    (like a modern netstatAX25 utility) to detect structure changes and
    adapt gracefully, making the interface more robust against future
    kernel modifications.

3.  LOW IMPACT: AX.25 is a niche protocol, and the number of user-space
    tools relying on its /proc file is limited. Existing applications
    can be trivially updated to regain compatibility by simply skipping
    the first line of output. The benefit of a normalized and more
    robust interface outweighs the minor breakage in this area.
