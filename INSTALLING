INSTALLING netstatAX25

This document explains how to compile and
install the netstatAX25 utility.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

You'll need a standard build environment:

- make
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- AX.25 development libraries (check your
  system's package manager).


1. COMPILE THE SOURCE
---------------------

Navigate to the project directory and run make:

    make

The executable, netstatAX25, will be created
in the current directory. Compilation should
finish without errors.


2. INSTALLATION
---------------

To install the compiled binary into the
system directory, use the install target:

    sudo make install

NOTE: You must use sudo (or root access)
to write files to system locations.


CUSTOMIZING PATHS

The installation path is defined in the Makefile.

- To preview the installation commands without
  running them (dry-run):

    make -n install

- To change the installation directory or
  permissions, edit the Makefile before
  running make install.


3. VERIFICATION
-----------------

Once the application is installed, run it
from any directory to confirm success:

    netstatAX25

If the application runs, installation is complete.
