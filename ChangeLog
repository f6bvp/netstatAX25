CHANGELOG

1.0.0 - 2025-10-21

The initial major release of netstatAX25, focused on providing robust and highly compatible AX.25 socket status reporting across various Linux kernel versions.

Added

    Initial release of the netstatAX25 utility.

    Implemented core functionality to read and display active AX.25 sockets from /proc/net/ax25.

    Added user-friendly INSTALLING and README.md files.

Changed

    State Mapping: Kernel numerical states are now mapped to legacy, user-friendly strings (e.g., 'ESTABLISHED', 'RECOVERY') for consistent user experience.

Fixed

    Kernel Compatibility: Resolved issues with the /proc/net/ax25 file format by introducing support for both headered and headerless data formats.

    Dynamic Indexing: Corrected field parsing to ensure State, Vs, Vr, Send-Q, and Recv-Q are read correctly, compensating for index shifts present in older kernel versions.

    Digipeater Extraction: Improved parsing logic to reliably extract comma-separated digipeaters from the destination field and display * when none are present.

    Error Handling: Enhanced error reporting to provide specific diagnostic messages for common file access and parsing errors.
