CHANGELOG

1.0.1 - 2025-10-22

Maintenance release focused on metrics. Updated display for sequence numbers.

Added

    Unacknowledged Frames (Va):

        Implemented logic to read the Va value.

        Displays unacknowledged frames from /proc/net/ax25.

Changed

    Sequence Display Format:

        The Vs/Vr column is updated.

        Now shows the full sequence status: Vs/Vr/Va.

        Provides a complete overview of frame counters.
        
        Vs (Send Sequence Number): "Displays the next frame number to be sent."

        Vr (Receive Sequence Number): "Displays the next frame number expected from the remote station."

        Va (Unacknowledged Frames): "Displays the number of frames sent but not yet acknowledged."

1.0.0 - 2025-10-21

Initial major release of netstatAX25. Focused on robust compatibility. Supports various Linux kernel versions.

Added

    Initial release of the netstatAX25 utility.

    Core functionality implemented: read and display active AX.25 sockets.

    Documentation files added: INSTALLING and README.md.

Changed

    State Mapping:

        Kernel numerical states are mapped.

        Uses user-friendly strings (e.g., ESTABLISHED).

Fixed

    Kernel Compatibility:

        Resolved issues with the /proc/net/ax25 file format.

        Supports both headered and headerless data formats.

    Dynamic Indexing:

        Corrected field parsing.

        Ensures accurate reading of queues and sequence numbers.

    Digipeater Extraction:

        Improved parsing logic.

        Reliably extracts comma-separated digipeaters.

    Error Handling:

        Enhanced specific diagnostic error reports.
